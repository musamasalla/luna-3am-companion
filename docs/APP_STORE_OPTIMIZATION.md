## Competitor Analysis

### Direct Competitors
| App | Strategy | Luna's Differentiation |
|-----|----------|------------------------|
| Replika | AI companion, relationship focus | Night-specific, no relationship framing |
| Woebot | CBT-based mental health | Conversational, not clinical |
| Wysa | Therapist-like AI | Companion, not therapy replacement |
| Youper | Mood tracking + AI | Pure conversation, no tracking pressure |

### Positioning
Luna occupies a unique niche: **AI companion specifically for late-night/insomnia moments**. This is underserved—most apps target general mental health, not the 3AM experience specifically.
